    description: "The modern Alfa Romeo Giulietta was a compact hatchback introduced to replace the 147. Built on the Fiat Group's Compact platform, it featured distinctive Alfa Romeo styling with hidden rear door handles for a coupe-like appearance. The Giulietta offered a range of engines, from a 1.4L MultiAir turbocharged four-cylinder to a 1.8L turbocharged four-cylinder producing 235 HP in the high-performance Quadrifoglio Verde version. Known for its engaging driving dynamics, the Giulietta received several updates throughout its production run, including a facelift in 2016 that refreshed its styling and interior technology. Despite its age, the model continued to embody Alfa Romeo's sporting character before being discontinued in 2020 without a direct replacement."
